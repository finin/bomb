<p>Born on My Birthday (BOMB) is a simple example of how a web site can use SPARQL to provide a service.  In this case, you can enter a date (e.g., your birthday) and see people in Wikipedia who were born on that date.  You can leave any of the fields blank to see up to 20 people born on a partial date. If there might be more results, you can click on the <b>MORE</b> button will appear at the bottom of the list to see them.</p>

<p>The Web site demo is implemented using <a href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html">Bottle</a>, a "a fast, simple and lightweight WSGI micro web-framework for Python. It is distributed as a single file module and has no dependencies other than the Python Standard Library."</p>

<p>doing <i>python bomb.py</i> will run bomb on your computer listening to port 8080.  Visit http://localhost:8080/bomb/ to try it.</p>

<p>The demo source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/finin/bomb.git">GitHub</a> and includes a copy of the bottle framework.</p>
